UI Checklist
Create a client side rendered web app written with React.√

It is highly recommended to use create-react-app to accomplish this.√

Create a React App using functional based components and hooks. No class based components, please.√

The app needs to have at least 2 pages (views):√

A landing page.√

A page renders a table displaying a list songs coming from the API.√

On mount of the this page, make a request to your API, fetching the songs and display the results in a table. √

Feel free to use whatever attributes you'd like (artist, song name, label, etc.)√

Use React Router to allow the user to change the page they are viewing.√

Style is not important, meaning you won't be evaluated on looks or design. If you'd like to make it look nice, by all means. √

It does not need to be mobile responsive.√
